<div id="why-did-i-get-trained" class="section level1">
<h1>Why did I get trained?</h1>
<p>Teaching R was not something I thought I’d ever get into when I started using R for my postdoc position. I had taken programming courses as an undergraduate student and still found myself hiking up a learning curve. My learning came primarily from code chunks from coworkers, StackOverflow, and the as-needed browsing of <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/">R for Data Science</a>. This approach was <em>ok</em> and served me to get where I needed to go for work projects, but it wasn’t methodical by any stretch of the imagination.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://education.arcus.chop.edu/user-groups/">CHOP R User group</a> lunch-and-learns and <a href="https://www.rladiesphilly.org/">R-Ladies Philly</a> meet-ups were showing me the robustness and versatility of R across disciplines and it quickly became clear there were very tangible ways I could use these skills to support a community organizing collective that I’m a part of. This would require teaching R to folks that don’t program and have very little, if any, experience handling data. I didn’t feel prepared to take this on knowing I had hiked down learning paths that I wouldn’t necessarily recommend to others.</p>
<p>Fast-forward and I can now say I feel prepared because the RStudio Instructor Training provided all the tools I need in order to take the next steps with my collective!</p>
<p>Read on to find out what I learned before I decided to pursue the certification, what the certification experience was like for me, and resources to support you in your own journey if you decide to take this path.</p>
