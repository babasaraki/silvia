<p>I used <strong>R</strong> to play around with <strong>webscraping</strong> and create an <a href="https://spcanelon.github.io/CCDSips2019.html/">interactive map</a> showing restaurants participating in Philly’s 2019 <a href="https://centercityphila.org/explore-center-city/ccdsips">Center City District Sips</a>. Center City Sips is a series of summer Wednesday evenings filled with <strong>happy hour specials</strong>.</p>
<p>This mini-project was motivated by two of my close friends’ frustration with the website shortcomings. <strong>The information was presented beautifully, but there was no map view</strong>! This made it difficult to figure out what happy hours you could check out nearby.</p>
<p>The map pop-ups could use information on the specials for each restaurant, but my newly acquired skills with the <code>RSelenium</code> and <code>Leaflet</code> packages weren’t quite up to the task! <strong>Suggestions and advice are welcome!</strong></p>
<p>I haven’t figured out how to fix the cute, but useless, baby <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> below but the link button at the top of the post will take you to a full screen version.</p>
