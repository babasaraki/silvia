# Where I started
With Alison Hill's [Up and Running with Blogdown](https://alison.rbind.io/post/2017-06-12-up-and-running-with-blogdown/) post! **Super helpful**, though because I came to it 2.5 years late, it was more like 'up and running with lots of water breaks' because I had to stop and account for changes made to the Hugo Academic theme in the meantime. The [going futher](https://alison.rbind.io/post/2017-06-12-up-and-running-with-blogdown/#going-further) section in that post specifically talks about customizing the out-of-the-box theme and Alison directly links to her custom `css` file, which I closely referred to when changing colors in [my custom scss file](https://github.com/spcanelon/silvia/blob/master/assets/scss/custom.scss). 

Alison's well-commented file helped me customize everything from text colors and fonts to alert colors and borders for Academic's light mode. At this point I had the light mode looking the way I wanted but the dark mode still used out-of-the-box colors and they **_just didn't go_**. [INSERT SCREENSHOT HERE](). So I decided not to enable the dark-mode option in `params.toml` until I could figure out how to customize the dark mode.



# Why Atom?

[Atom](https://atom.io/) is a text editor that I like to use to _modify_ any files in my website directory. I say modify because I much prefer to _create_ content for posts like this one using the [Blogdown addins in RStudio](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/rstudio-ide.html). It's such a breeze! But here's why I think Atom is a fantastic companion to the RStudio IDE:

1. **Seeing your directory files is made friendly in Tree View** when you open your website folder as a 'project folder'. You can just click on the file once to preview it and double-click if you want to actually open it. I find this to be really helpful when I can't remember which file contains what I'm looking for because I don't have to actually open each file to see what's in it.
2. **Searching for something specific is easy with the built-in search tool**. I've used this many times when I can't remember where that specific parameter (e.g. fonts) or file type (e.g. `.scss`) is located within my directory. In particular I find it super handy to find specific HTML color codes, but more on that later! This brings me to my most favorite feature in Atom...
3. **The [pigments](https://atom.io/packages/pigments) package!** Like R, Atom has a universe of handy packages and `pigments` will **display colors** behind the color code that you type out. It's kind of magical and has been a real game changer for me. I guarantee you that having this package will make customizing your scss file much easier on the eyes and brain. You may also choose to install the [highlight-selected](https://atom.io/packages/highlight-selected) package to make highlighted text easier to spot throughout your file and the [file-icons](https://atom.io/packages/file-icons) package to make it easier to discern between different file types in your tree view.You can install packages in Atom _Settings > Install_.

# HTML sleuthing

I started by figuring out which out-of-the-box colors were the ones I wanted to change by using my browser's **Inspect Element** tool on various elements of the [Hugo Academic documentation website](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/customization/) in dark mode.
