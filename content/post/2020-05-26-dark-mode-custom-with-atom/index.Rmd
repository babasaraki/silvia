# Where I started
With Alison Hill's [Up and Running with Blogdown](https://alison.rbind.io/post/2017-06-12-up-and-running-with-blogdown/) post! **Super helpful**, though because I came to it 2.5 years late, it was more like 'up and running with lots of water breaks' because I had to stop and account for changes made to the Hugo Academic theme in the meantime. The [going futher](https://alison.rbind.io/post/2017-06-12-up-and-running-with-blogdown/#going-further) section specifically talks about customizing the out-of-the-box theme and Alison directly links to her custom `css` file, which I closely referred to when changing colors in [my custom css/scss file](https://github.com/spcanelon/silvia/blob/master/assets/scss/custom.scss).

Alison's file helped me customize everything from text colors and fonts to alert colors and borders for Hugo Academic's light mode. At this point I had the light mode looking the way I wanted but the dark mode still used out-of-the-box colors and they _just didn't go_. [INSERT SCREENSHOT HERE](). So I decided not to enable the dark-mode option in `params.toml` until I could figure out how to customize the dark mode.
