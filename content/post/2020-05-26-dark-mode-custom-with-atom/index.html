<div id="where-i-started" class="section level1">
<h1>Where I started</h1>
<p>With Alison Hill’s <a href="https://alison.rbind.io/post/2017-06-12-up-and-running-with-blogdown/">Up and Running with Blogdown</a> post! <strong>Super helpful</strong>, though because I came to it 2.5 years late, it was more like ‘up and running with lots of water breaks’ because I had to stop and account for changes made to the Hugo Academic theme in the meantime.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, prior to Academic version 4.6, custom CSS was added using the <code>plugins_css</code> option in <code>params.toml</code>, but <a href="https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/customization/#customize-style-css">in current version 4.8</a>, the theme supports SCSS (a superset of CSS) and a <code>custom.scss</code> file is added in the <code>assets/scss/</code> folder.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://alison.rbind.io/post/2017-06-12-up-and-running-with-blogdown/#going-further">going futher</a> section in Alison’s post specifically talks about customizing the out-of-the-box theme and Alison directly links to her custom CSS file, which I closely referred to when changing colors in <a href="https://github.com/spcanelon/silvia/blob/master/assets/scss/custom.scss">my custom SCSS file</a>.</p>
<p>Alison’s well-commented CSS style sheet helped me customize everything from text colors and fonts to alert colors and borders for Academic’s light mode. At this point I had the light mode looking the way I wanted but the dark mode still used out-of-the-box colors and they <strong><em>just didn’t go</em></strong>. <a href="">INSERT DARK MODE SCREENSHOT HERE</a></p>
<p>So I decided not to enable the dark-mode option in <code>params.toml</code> until I could figure out how to customize my stylesheet accordingly. That time has come because it turns out <a href="https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/issues/988#issuecomment-475896178">it’s pretty straightforward</a>!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/css.html">Blogdown book</a> does an excellent job summarizing what you need to know about CSS. This tutorial builds on that a little by incorporating <a href="https://sass-lang.com/guide">features made possible by SCSS</a> including variables and nested syntax.</p>

<div id="why-atom" class="section level1">
<h1>Why Atom?</h1>
<p><a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> is a text editor that I like to use to <em>modify</em> any files in my website directory. I say modify because I much prefer to <em>create</em> content for posts like this one using the <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/rstudio-ide.html">Blogdown addins in RStudio</a>. It’s such a breeze! But here’s why I think Atom is a fantastic companion to the RStudio IDE:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Seeing your directory files is made friendly in Tree View</strong> when you open your website folder as a ‘project folder’. You can just click on the file once to preview it and double-click if you want to actually open it. I find this to be really helpful when I can’t remember which file contains what I’m looking for because I don’t have to actually open each file to see what’s in it.</li>
<li><strong>Searching for something specific is easy with the built-in search tool</strong>. I’ve used this many times when I can’t remember where that specific parameter (e.g. fonts) or file type (e.g. <code>.scss</code>) is located within my directory. In particular I find it super handy to find specific HTML color codes, but more on that later! This brings me to my most favorite feature in Atom…</li>
<li><strong>The <a href="https://atom.io/packages/pigments">pigments</a> package!</strong> Like R, Atom has a universe of handy packages and <code>pigments</code> will <strong>display colors</strong> behind the color code that you type out. It’s kind of magical and has been a real game changer for me. I guarantee you that having this package will make customizing your scss file much easier on the eyes and brain. You may also choose to install the <a href="https://atom.io/packages/highlight-selected">highlight-selected</a> package to make highlighted text easier to spot throughout your file and the <a href="https://atom.io/packages/file-icons">file-icons</a> package to make it easier to discern between different file types in your tree view.You can install packages in Atom <em>Settings &gt; Install</em>.</li>
</ol>

<div id="html-sleuthing" class="section level1">
<h1>HTML sleuthing</h1>
<p>I started by figuring out which out-of-the-box colors were the ones I wanted to change by using my browser’s <strong>Inspect Element</strong> tool on various elements of a <a href="https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/customization/">Hugo Academic theme documentation site</a> in dark mode.</p>
