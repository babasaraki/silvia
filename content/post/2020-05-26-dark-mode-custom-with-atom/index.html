<h1>Where I started</h1>
<p>With Alison Hill’s <a href="https://alison.rbind.io/post/2017-06-12-up-and-running-with-blogdown/">Up and Running with Blogdown</a> post! <strong>Super helpful</strong>, though because I came to it 2.5 years late, it was more like ‘up and running with lots of water breaks’ because I had to stop and account for changes made to the Hugo Academic theme in the meantime. The <a href="https://alison.rbind.io/post/2017-06-12-up-and-running-with-blogdown/#going-further">going futher</a> section specifically talks about customizing the out-of-the-box theme and Alison directly links to her custom <code>css</code> file, which I closely referred to when changing colors in <a href="https://github.com/spcanelon/silvia/blob/master/assets/scss/custom.scss">my custom css/scss file</a>.</p>
<p>Alison’s file helped me customize everything from text colors and fonts to alert colors and borders for Hugo Academic’s light mode. At this point I had the light mode looking the way I wanted but the dark mode still used out-of-the-box colors and they <em>just didn’t go</em>. <a href="">INSERT SCREENSHOT HERE</a>. So I decided not to enable the dark-mode option in <code>params.toml</code> until I could figure out how to customize the dark mode.</p>
