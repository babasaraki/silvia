abstract: 'Objective: To develop an algorithm that infers patient delivery dates (PDDs) and delivery-specific details from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with high accuracy. Materials and Methods: We obtained EHR data from 1,060,100 female patients treated at Penn Medicine hospitals or outpatient clinics between 2010-2017. We developed an algorithm called MADDIE: Method to Acquire Delivery Date Information from Electronic Health Records that infers a PDD for distinct deliveries based on EHR encounter dates assigned a delivery code, the frequency of code usage, and the time differential between code assignments. We validated MADDIEs PDDs against a birth log independently maintained by the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Results: MADDIE identified 50,560 patients having 63,334 distinct deliveries. MADDIE was 98.6% accurate (F1-score 92.1%) when compared to the birth log. The PDD was on average 0.68 days earlier than the true delivery date for patients with only one delivery (± 1.43 days) and 0.52 days earlier for patients with more than one delivery episode (± 1.11 days). Discussion: MADDIE is the first algorithm to successfully infer PDD information using only structured delivery codes and identify multiple deliveries per patient. MADDIE is also the first to validate the accuracy of the PDD using an external gold standard of known delivery dates as opposed to manual chart review of a sample. Conclusion: MADDIE infers delivery dates and delivery-specific details from the EHR with high accuracy and relies only on structured EHR elements while harnessing temporal information and the frequency of code usage to identify accurate PDDs.'
summary: 'Preprint for an algorithm designed to extract delivery details from electronic health records.'
