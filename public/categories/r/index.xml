&lt;div id=&#34;why-did-i-get-trained&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why did I get trained?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teaching R was not something I thought I’d ever get into when I started using R for my postdoc position. I had taken programming courses as an undergraduate student and still found myself hiking up a learning curve. My learning came primarily from code chunks from coworkers, StackOverflow, and the as-needed browsing of &lt;a href=&#34;https://r4ds.had.co.nz/&#34;&gt;R for Data Science&lt;/a&gt;. This approach was &lt;em&gt;ok&lt;/em&gt; and served me to get where I needed to go for work projects, but it wasn’t methodical by any stretch of the imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href=&#34;https://education.arcus.chop.edu/user-groups/&#34;&gt;CHOP R User group&lt;/a&gt; lunch-and-learns and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rladiesphilly.org/&#34;&gt;R-Ladies Philly&lt;/a&gt; meet-ups were showing me the robustness and versatility of R across disciplines and it quickly became clear there were very tangible ways I could use these skills to support a community organizing collective that I’m a part of. This would require teaching R to folks that don’t program and have very little, if any, experience handling data. I didn’t feel prepared to take this on knowing I had hiked down learning paths that I wouldn’t necessarily recommend to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward and I can now say I feel prepared because the RStudio Instructor Training provided all the tools I need in order to take the next steps with my collective!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read on to find out what I learned before I decided to pursue the certification, what the certification experience was like for me, and resources to support you in your own journey if you decide to take this path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
